# Dynamic-Route-Optimization-
Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction System 

Steps to Develop the System:
Integration of APIs:

TomTom or Google Maps API: Fetch real-time traffic data.
AQICN API: Retrieve weather and air quality data.
OSRM API: Generate optimal routes.
System Features:

Input Module: Users can input vehicle details (e.g., fuel type, emission rate) and destinations.
Route Optimization: Compute multiple route options based on traffic and weather data.
Emission Estimation: Calculate estimated emissions for each route using vehicle-specific data.
User Interface: Provide an intuitive interface for users to view route and emission details.
Python Libraries and Tools:

requests for API calls.
Flask or Django for a web interface.
matplotlib or plotly for visualizations.
pandas for data handling and analysis.
Would you like me to start creating a detailed technical design or Python implementation for this system?
